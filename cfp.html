<p>The inaugural Functional Programming Miniconf is being held during <a href="https://linux.conf.au/">linux.conf.au 2016</a>, the week of 1st - 5th February 2016 in <a href="https://linux.conf.au/about/geelong">Geelong, Victoria</a>.</p>
<p>This one-day miniconf is for FP beginners and practitioners alike. Attendees will learn FP concepts, tools and techniques and be challenged to think about programming in new ways and embrace the benefits of FP in their workplaces and open source communities.</p>
<p>If you have something interesting to share about FP, read on!</p>
<h2 id="what-are-we-looking-for">What are we looking for?</h2>
<p>We are looking for talks that will interest FP newcomers and experienced practitioners alike. linux.conf.au attendees have diverse programming and computing experience; accordingly we are unlikely to accept proposals that assume significant prior knowledge of FP, category theory, etc.</p>
<p>Here are some possible topic areas, to get the ideas flowing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teach an FP concept that can be applied in a variety of langauges, including those not normally considered “functional”.</li>
<li>Demonstrate an emerging programming tool or technique such as hole-driven development or proof search.</li>
<li>Share your experience of learning or teaching FP, starting a meetup, or adopting FP in your workplace.</li>
<li>Explain the benefits of FP for writing correct, maintainable and high performance software.</li>
<li>Show how FP is used to build some awesome and/or well known free software program.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the conference proper, <em>all talks must relate to free/open source software</em> in some way.</p>
<p>First-time speakers are encouraged to apply! If you would like help fleshing out an abstract or have any questions feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact the organisers</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-submit">How to submit</h2>
<p>Email proposals to <code>frase@frase.id.au</code>.</p>
<p>The submission deadline is <strong>Monday 9th November</strong>.</p>
<p>The standard talk duration is 30 minutes <em>including time for questions</em>.</p>
<p>Include the following in your proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk title</li>
<li>Abstract (a few paragraphs)</li>
<li>A short bio</li>
</ul>
<p>This information will be used in the miniconf programme. If you wish you can include links or fancy formatting in your abstract by using ReStructured Text or Markdown.</p>
<p>Please note the following important points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speakers at the miniconf <strong>must</strong> register for the conference. Miniconf-only registration is available from $90. Student, hobbyist and professional rates are available for the full conference. See the <a href="https://linux.conf.au/register/info">Registration Information</a> page for details.</li>
