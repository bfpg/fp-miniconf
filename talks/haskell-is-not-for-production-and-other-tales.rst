Haskell is Not For Production and Other Tales
=============================================

Some say it was written exclusively for Unix-bearded wizards with
PhDs. Some say only 10x programmers and unicorns can decipher its
many operators.  Some say any coding problem it touches will be
saved from callback hell and find everlasting peace. The Haskell
programming language has long been the subject of myths and
misconceptions. Nonetheless it has been adopted by a slew of
companies big and small, including Facebook, which has a large
Haskell deployment and dozens of engineers using the language.

In this keynote, Katie will explore some of the pervasive
stereotypes about the poster child of statically typed functional
programming and compare and contrast them with her experiences
working as a Haskell developer on the open-source Haxl project,
which is used to fight spam at Facebook.  As the former journalist
investigates which stories stack up, she'll share insights on what
functional programming and Haskell have to offer, the challenges
that come with their use, and where the ecosystem could be improved.

pump out shorthand faster and more accurately than she can type.
