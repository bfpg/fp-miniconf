The inaugural Functional Programming Miniconf is being held during
`linux.conf.au 2016`_, the week of 1st - 5th February 2016 in
`Geelong, Victoria`_.

This one-day miniconf is for FP beginners and practitioners alike.
Attendees will learn FP concepts, tools and techniques and be
challenged to think about programming in new ways and embrace the
benefits of FP in their workplaces and open source communities.

Lineup
======

We already have a few tricks up our sleeves, and will announce our
fabulous keynote speaker(s) soon.  But we also need you (yes,
*you*!)  If you have something interesting to say about FP - a tool
you wrote, a handy library you discovered, your experiences learning
or teaching FP - **`submit a proposal`_** to share the goodness!

.. _submit a proposal: cfp.html

============

Conference registration is required to attend the miniconf.
Miniconf-only registration is available **from $90**.  Student,

About FP
========

`*Functional programming*`_ is an approach to programming that
models computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.  It
draws from fields of math including `lambda calculus`_ and `category
theory`_ and emphasises `*purity*`_, `*immutability*`_,
`*abstraction*`_ and `*composability*`_.  These qualities underpin
FP's reputation for succinctness, comprehensibility and the ability
to move fast and *not* break things.

In recent years awareness and use of functional programming has
grown with the emergence of new languages (e.g. Scala, Clojure,
Idris), ongoing advancement of older functional programming
languages (e.g. OCaml, Haskell) and other languages adopting
features to better facilitate functional programming (e.g. Java 8,
C# 3.0).

Some popular open source functional programming languages
include:

- Haskell_: pure, lazy, statically typed
- Scala_: statically typed functional language for the JVM 
- Clojure_: JVM Lisp dialect with powerful concurrency primitives
- Erlang_: dynamically typed with focus on fault tolerance and 
  real-time applications
- `F#`_: statically typed FP for Common Language Infrastructure

Some well-known open source programs written in functional
programming languages include:

- xmonad_ (window manager; Haskell)
- git-annex_ (Git-based archiving tool; Haskell)
- CouchDB_ and Riak_ (databases; Erlang)
- Pandoc_ (universal document converter; Haskell)
- Lichess_ (Internet chess server; Scala)
- MirageOS_ (Unikernel toolkit; OCaml)
- ejabberd_ (XMPP server; Erlang)
- Puppet_ (configuration management; Clojure)
