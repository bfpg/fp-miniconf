<p>Functional Programming presents a thesis for how programs should be organised, removing mutation and other side-effects in order to make them simpler and easier to reason about.</p>
<p>While this may be imaginable in the small, it seems far lees obvious how to apply this in the large to real-world systems we build, systems that process and query data, systems that are going through constant apparent change.</p>
<p>What are the techniques and tools of functional programming that we can bring to bear upon these problems? How do they make our lives simpler? Weâ€™ll look at how these ideas are crucial to building any reliable software.</p>
