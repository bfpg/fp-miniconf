Data made out of functions
==========================

Church Encoding is a fascinating technique whereby numbers, data
structures, and just about anything can be built out of nothing but
functions.

Ken will introduce Church Encoding and show how it can make numbers
and data types materialise out of thin air.

Even better, he'll show how Church Encoding is not only a neat party
trick, but actually useful in real code, using examples in Haskell
and Java.
