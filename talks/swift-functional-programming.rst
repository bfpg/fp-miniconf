Swift Functional Programming
============================

Swift_ is one of the most interesting modern languages that you’ll
encounter in your travels, and with its recent open-source release
growing its relevance across myriad different communities, it’s a
language worth learning. Swift is great for traditional, imperative
programming, but especially excels at functional programming.

This session will explore the basics of functional programming with
Swift 2.0 using examples. It operates under the assumption that you
are familiar with iterative programming in a relatively modern, or
heavily-used language, such as Python, Java, C#, Perl 6, or similar.
We’ll explore some of the things functional programming is good at,
such as filtering, reducing numbers, indexing, and more, and we’ll
do it using Swift’s powerful and easy-to-understand functional
programming features. We’ll also do it using Swift’s really, really,
really cool REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) live programming
environment, Playgrounds.

Learn why Swift might be useful to you, how to use it for the basics
of functional programming, and where to go next on your Swift
adventure.  We’ll also briefly look at how to set it up under Linux,
as well as popular open-source libraries to make functional
programming even more exciting with Swift, such as `Dollar.swift`_,
Promissum_, Result_, and Swiftz_.
