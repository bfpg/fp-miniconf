<blockquote>
<p><em>In my brief experience people rarely take this [streaming] route. They use single-threaded in-memory Python until it breaks, and then seek out Big Data Infrastructure like Hadoop/Spark at relatively high productivity overhead.</em> ~ Matt Rocklin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That quote succinctly summarises my computational life, right up until recent months.</p>
<p>In “traditional” programming, you load a dataset into memory, process it in some way, and output the result. This is simple to understand. But in streaming programs, a function processes <em>some</em> of the data, <em>yields</em> the processed chunk, then downstream functions deal with that chunk, then the original function receives a bit more, and so on… All these things are going on at the same time! How can one keep them straight?</p>
<p>This talk will introduce Matt Rocklin’s <em>Toolz</em> library which makes functional programming easy in Python and provides a framework to write elegant, concise code to analyse bigger-than-memory data, and <em>fn.py</em>, which has even more FP constructs. I’ll present streaming data analysis using FP from the ground up, from a simple “hello-world” example to image illumination correction and streaming extensions to scikit-learn classifiers, and analysing a genome in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Juan is a research scientist at the University of Melbourne’s Victorian Life Sciences Computation Initiative. His undergraduate degree was in biomedical science, but he slowly veered towards a computational biology and software engineering career. He is a core developer of the scikit-image library, teacher of scientific programming, and author of an upcoming book about the SciPy library. I am also author of the (decidedly non-functional!) gala image segmentation library.</p>
