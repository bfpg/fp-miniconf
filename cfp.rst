The inaugural Functional Programming Miniconf is being held during
`linux.conf.au 2016`_, the week of 1st - 5th February 2016 in
`Geelong, Victoria`_.

This one-day miniconf is for FP beginners and practitioners alike.
Attendees will learn FP concepts, tools and techniques and be
challenged to think about programming in new ways and embrace the
benefits of FP in their workplaces and open source communities.

What are we looking for?
------------------------

We are looking for talks that will interest FP newcomers and
experienced practitioners alike.  linux.conf.au attendees have
diverse programming and computing experience; accordingly we are
unlikely to accept proposals that assume significant prior knowledge
of FP, category theory, etc.

In particular, we welcome proposals that:

- Teach FP concepts or techniques that are applicable in a variety
  of languages, including languages not normally considered
  "functional".

- Blow minds with emerging tools or techniques, and introduce the
  underlying theory.

- Clearly convey the benefits of FP for writing correct,
  maintainable and high performance software.

- Demonstrate awesome open source programs or libraries written in a
  functional programming language and expound important aspects of
  their implementation.

- Educate attendees on how to learn or teach FP effectively.

As with the conference proper, *all talks must relate to free/open
source software* in some way.

First-time speakers are encouraged to apply!  If you would like help
fleshing out an abstract or have any questions feel free to
`contact the organisers`_.
