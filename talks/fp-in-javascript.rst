The Emperor's New Closure: FP in Javascript
===========================================

Right at this moment, something terrible is being written in
Javascript.  But that's because Javascript's best features are
invisible---I mean, only visible to the wise!  We'll look at how to
use functional techniques already available in JS to write clearer,
safer code without dressing it up in bulky libraries, including:

* higher-order functions
* closures
* map/filter/fold
* laziness
* pseudo-classes
