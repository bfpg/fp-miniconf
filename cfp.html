<p>The linux.conf.au 2016 Functional Programming (FP) Miniconf will provide the opportunity for FP practitioners and people interested in FP to learn the concepts, tools and techniques of FP in a supportive environment, to be challenged in their thinking about programming and the tools of the craft, and to be inspired to embrace the advantages of FP in their workplaces and open source projects and communities.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"><em>Functional programming</em></a> is an approach to programming that models computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. Drawing from fields of mathematics including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a>, FP emphasises <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function"><em>purity</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object"><em>immutability</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_%28computer_science%29"><em>abstraction</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_compositionality"><em>composability</em></a> - qualities that underpin FP’s reputation of succinctness, comprehensibility and the ability to move fast and <em>not</em> break things.</p>
<h2 id="a-little-background">A little background</h2>
<p>In recent years awareness and use of functional programming has grown with the emergence of new languages (e.g. Scala, Clojure, Idris), ongoing advancement of older functional programming languages (e.g. OCaml, Haskell) and other languages adopting features to better facilitate functional programming (e.g. Java 8, C# 3.0).</p>
<p>Some popular open source functional programming languages include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>: pure, lazy, statically typed</li>
<li><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>: statically typed functional language for the JVM</li>
<li><a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>: JVM Lisp dialect with powerful concurrency primitives</li>
<li><a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>: dynamically typed with focus on fault tolerance and real-time applications</li>
<li><a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a>: statically typed FP for Common Language Infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<p>Some well-known open source programs written in functional programming languages include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://xmonad.org/">xmonad</a> (window manager; Haskell)</li>
<li><a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com/">git-annex</a> (Git-based archiving tool; Haskell)</li>
<li><a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> and <a href="https://github.com/basho/riak">Riak</a> (databases; Erlang)</li>
<li><a href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> (universal document converter; Haskell)</li>
<li><a href="http://lichess.org/">Lichess</a> (Internet chess server; Scala)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-we-looking-for">What are we looking for?</h2>
<p>We are looking for talks that will interest FP newcomers and experienced practitioners alike. Accordingly, we are unlikely to accept proposals that assume significant prior knowledge of FP, category theory, etc. As with the conference proper, all talks must relate in some way to free/open source software.</p>
<p>In particular, we welcome proposals that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teach FP concepts or techniques that are applicable in a variety of languages, including languages not normally considered “functional”.</li>
<li>Blow minds with emerging tools or techniques, and introduce the underlying theory.</li>
<li>Clearly convey the benefits of FP for writing correct, maintainable and high performance software.</li>
<li>Demonstrate awesome open source programs or libraries written in a functional programming language and expound important aspects of their implementation.</li>
<li>Educate attendees on how to learn or teach FP effectively.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-submit">How to submit</h2>
<p>Email proposals to <code>frase@frase.id.au</code>. The standard talk duration is 30 minutes <em>including time for questions</em>.</p>
<p>Include the following in your proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk title</li>
<li>Abstract (a few paragraphs)</li>
<li>A short bio</li>
</ul>
<p>This information will be used in the miniconf programme. If you wish you can include links or fancy formatting in your abstract by using ReStructured Text or Markdown.</p>
<p>Please note the following important points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speakers at the miniconf must <a href="https://linux.conf.au/">register for the main conference</a>.</li>
<li>The FP Miniconf organisers are unable to provide financial assistance for travel or registration.</li>
<li>All speakers and attendees are subject to the linux.conf.au <a href="https://linux.conf.au/register/code_of_conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.</li>
</ul>
