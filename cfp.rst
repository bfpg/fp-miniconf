`linux.conf.au 2016`_, the week of 1st - 5th February 2016 in
`Geelong, Victoria`_.

This one-day miniconf is for FP beginners and practitioners alike.

What are we looking for?
------------------------

We are looking for talks that will interest FP newcomers and
experienced practitioners alike.  linux.conf.au attendees have
diverse programming and computing experience; accordingly we are
unlikely to accept proposals that assume significant prior knowledge
of FP, category theory, etc.

Here are some possible topic areas, to get the ideas flowing:

- Teach an FP concept that can be applied in a variety of langauges,
  including those not normally considered "functional".

- Demonstrate an emerging programming tool or technique such as
  hole-driven development or proof search.

- Share your experience of learning or teaching FP, starting a
  meetup, or adopting FP in your workplace.

- Explain the benefits of FP for writing correct, maintainable and
  high performance software.

- Show how FP is used to build some awesome and/or well known free
  software program.

As with the conference proper, *all talks must relate to free/open
source software* in some way.

First-time speakers are encouraged to apply!  If you would like help
fleshing out an abstract or have any questions feel free to
`contact the organisers`_.

How to submit
